# DDoS Botnet Attack Detection

Prevent DDoS Attacks to IoT-Devices by analyzing network packets and detecting malicious ones.

## Overview

In this project, I have implemented stages of a Data Mining task to detect network packets that are related to DDoS attacks. This task is a classification problem.

Stages of the work include:
* EDA
* Data Preprocessing
* Model Implementation

Also, two datasets have been used for this task that are accessible in the links below:

## Usage

Files could be opened by using Jupyter Notebook.
